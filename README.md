# Telegram Bot (SOURCE CODE)
# Weather Bot

This repository contains the source code for a Telegram bot that can parse weather information from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The bot can tell you the current temperature, forecast, and more information about the weather in your area.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Once you have your API key, replace the placeholder value in `config.py` with your own key.

Once you have the API key set up, you can run the bot using the `python main.py` command.

## Using the Bot

Once the bot is running, you can use the command `/weather` to get the current weather at your location. You can also use the `/forecast` command to get a 5-day forecast for your area.
